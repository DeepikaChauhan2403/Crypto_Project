<h1>Dashboard</h1>
<p> * On the Dashboard, we fetch details of 100 bitcoins using the CoinGecko API and display 10 of them per page. The dashboard includes search and pagination features for easier navigation. Additionally, users can choose between two viewing options: grid and list. We also provide a watchlist feature, allowing users to add coins they are interested in and collect them for quick access.</p>
